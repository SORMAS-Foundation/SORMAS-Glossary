                <h2 id="brief-notes">Brief Notes</h2>
<p>A case of a disease, syndrome, or health condition is determined by a set of standard clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological criteria called case definitions. Case definitions are useful for making uniform decisions of whether or not; an individual has a disease or health event of interest. </p>
<ul>
<li>The clinical criteria include characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease in question.</li>
<li>The epidemiological criteria (person, place, and time) include the characteristics of the population at risk (person), the geographical location or distribution of cases or event (place), and the timing of event or outbreak (time). For example, an exposure to possible infection such as a confirmed case, animals, substances, or a geographical area (jurisdiction) with ongoing outbreak will constitute an epidemiological link.</li>
<li>Laboratory criteria consist of at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease. </li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the applicable criteria, cases are generally classified into three categories (case classification). These categories in increasing order of certainty of diagnosis are: </p>
<p><strong>Suspected case:</strong> a person that exhibits compatible clinical signs and/or symptoms of a given disease or syndrome, but without laboratory confirmation. 
<strong>Probable case:</strong> a person that exhibits compatible clinical features and has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak, but without laboratory confirmation. <strong>Confirmed case:</strong> a person that has a laboratory confirmation of disease or syndrome (at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease) with or without clinical symptoms or epidemiological link. </p>
<h2 id="overview-of-case-glossary">Overview of Case Glossary</h2>
<p>The default view of the case directory displays the list of cases in the system. It also has icons to permit users to perform operations such as creating a case, importing list of cases, exporting cases from the system, and bulk editing of cases. It also displays filters, for viewing the case lists by desired variables. The detailed view displays the list of cases with more variables. The follow-up view displays cases under monitoring (follow-up) with information on the daily status of each case over the follow-up period. </p>
<p>For a detailed understanding of the filters and icons on the case directory, we recommend that you first read the section titled ‚ÄúCase Entity‚Äù</p>
