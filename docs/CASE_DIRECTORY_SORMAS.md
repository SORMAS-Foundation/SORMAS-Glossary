# **CASE DIRECTORY**

## **Brief Notes**

A case of a disease, syndrome, or health condition is determined by a set of standard clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological criteria called case definitions. Case definitions are useful for making uniform decisions of whether or not; an individual has a disease or health event of interest. 

* The clinical criteria include characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease in question.

* The epidemiological criteria (person, place, and time) include the characteristics of the population at risk (person), the geographical location or distribution of cases or event (place), and the timing of event or outbreak (time). For example, an  exposure to possible infection such as a confirmed case, animals, substances, or a geographical area (jurisdiction) with ongoing outbreak will constitute an epidemiological link.

* Laboratory criteria consist of at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease. 

Based on the applicable criteria, cases are generally classified into three categories (case classification). These categories in increasing order of certainty of diagnosis are: 

**Suspected case:** a person that exhibits compatible clinical signs and/or symptoms of a given disease or syndrome, but without laboratory confirmation. 

**Probable case:** a person that exhibits compatible clinical features and has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak, but without laboratory confirmation. 

**Confirmed case:** a person that has a laboratory confirmation of disease or syndrome (at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease) with or without clinical symptoms or epidemiological link. 

## **Overview of Case Directory on SORMAS**

The default view of the case directory displays the list of cases in the system. It also has icons to permit users to perform operations such as creating a case, importing list of cases, exporting cases from the system, and bulk editing of cases. It also displays filters, for viewing the case lists by desired variables. The detailed view displays the list of cases with more variables. The follow-up view displays cases under monitoring (follow-up) with information on the daily status of each case over the follow-up period.  

For a detailed understanding of the filters and icons on the case directory, we recommend that you first read the section titled “Case Entity”

### **Glossary to Case Directory**

1. **Default view:** The listing of cases with pre-selected subset of variables.
2. **Detailed view:** The listing of cases with additional variables.
3. **Follow-up:** The summary page of the daily monitoring / follow-up records of cases.
4. **Import:** The feature used to import cases. Cases can be imported as either line listing, or detailed import of cases into the SORMAS database from a .csv file. Line listing is used to import cases with variable related to the case person only while detailed case import can be used to import cases together with their samples and pathogen tests. 
5. **Export:** A feature used to export data in .csv format. 
6. **Basic export:** A feature used to export case data with the variables available on the default view.
7. **Detailed export:** A feature used to export data with all the variables of a case including associated samples and pathogen tests.  
8. **Case management export:** A feature used to export cases with their associated clinical assessment, prescription and treatment data.
9. **Sample export:** A feature used to export sample data of cases.
10. **Custom case export:** A flexible user-defined export feature that allows users to define the variables of cases they wish to export. 
11. **Line listing:** A feature for quick case creation. For cases with the same disease and jurisdiction (region, district, facility), the user just has to specify these once and then only complete the person specific data for each case.
12. **New case:** A feature to register a new case.
13. **More:** A feature that presents users with additional functionalities within the default and detailed views of case directory namely: ‘open case guide', ‘enter bulk edit mode’, ‘merge duplicates’, and ‘search for specific case’.
14. **Open case guide:** A feature used to display how performance indicators (e.g. data completeness) of a case are defined in SORMAS.  
15. **Enter bulk edit mode:** A feature used to execute the same action (edit, delete, and archive) to many cases in one process or step.
16. **Merge duplicates:** A feature used to detect and merge duplicate cases.
17. **Search specific case:** A feature used to search for a specific case. Search text can be case ID, external ID, or epid number.

	**Filters on the default and detailed views of the case directory permit users to sort case by variables of interest. These are:** 
	
18. **Case Origin:** To filter cases using the origin of the case (in-country, point of entry). In-country cases are cases identified within the country, while point of entry cases are those identified at boarders to the country (imported cases). 
19. **Outcome of case:** To filter cases by outcome namely: no outcome, recovered, deceased, and unknown.
20. **Disease:** To filter cases by the disease  Acute Flaccid Paralysis, Anthrax, COVID-19, Cholera, Congenital Rubella, Dengue Fever, Ebola Virus Disease, Guinea Worm, Human Rabies, Lassa Fever, Measles, Meningitis [CSM], Monkeypox, Plaque, Poliomyelitis, Unspecified VHF, Yellow Fever, Not Yet Defined, Other Epidemiological Disease, ...).
21. **Case classification:** To filter cases by the case classification (unclassified, suspected, probable, confirmed, not a case). 
22. **Follow-up status:** To filter cases by their state of follow-up (under follow-up, completed follow-up, cancelled follow-up, lost to follow-up, and no follow-up).
23. **Show more filters/Show less filters:** A feature that allows a switch between the filters displayed by default and all the possible filters.
24. **Reset filters:** To return filters to the default setting.
25. **Apply filters:** To execute filter selections.
26. **Present condition:** To filter cases by the present condition of the associated case person (alive, dead, buried, and unknown).
27. **Responsible region:** To filter cases by a region in a country where a case was identified.
28. **Responsible surveillance officer:**  To filter cases by surveillance officers responsible them.
29. **Reported by:** To filter cases by the role of the users who created them.
30. **Reporting user:** To filter cases by the username of the user who created them.
31. **Quarantine end:** To filter cases by the last date of quarantine.
32. **Follow-up until:** To filter cases by their expected date of last follow-up.
33. **Year of birth:** To filter cases by the calendar year of birth. 
34. **Month of birth:**  To filter cases by the calendar month of birth.
35. **By date:** To filter cases by a time interval of notification or report. The time interval can either be a calendar period or epidemiological week.
36. **Most relevant date:** To specify the date type used on the time filter namely: symptom onset date, case report date, and most relevant date (combination of both onset and report date, depending on available data).
37. **New cases from …. to:** A composite filter for selecting cases by a desired period (date range).
38. **Investigation pending:** To filter cases whose investigation status is still pending.
39. **Investigation done:** To filter cases whose investigation status is completed. 
40. **Investigation discarded:** To filter cases whose investigation status have been discontinued.

	**On the top right corner of the case list there is the following dropdown menu:**

41. **Active cases:** To filter active cases. Active cases are those that are still under investigation, follow-up, or clinical management. 
42. **Archived cases:** To Filter cases that have been archived. 
43. **All cases:** To display both active and archived cases.
