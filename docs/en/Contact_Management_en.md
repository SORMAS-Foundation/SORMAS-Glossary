## Brief Note

A contact is an exposure of a non infected person (contact person) to an infected person (case person).  These exposures can include: face-to-face contact with a case person, direct physical contact with a case person, or other settings as indicated by local risk assessments.

An important and indispensable strategy for controlling the spread of an infectious disease outbreaks is contact tracing. Contact tracing  helps to identify and break chains of transmission. However, in order to reap the full benefit of contact tracing, it has to be systematically applied. Contact tracing involves three sequential activities viz. contact identification, contact listing and classification, contact follow-up (monitoring for disease onset).
