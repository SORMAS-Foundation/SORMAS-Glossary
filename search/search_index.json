By these attributes, dashboards facilitate informed decision making using multiple combinations of indicators and figures obtained from data analyses. In this way, dashboards improve situational awareness - especially for ongoing outbreak responses. Aside from providing visuals for speedy situational assessment, epidemiological dashboards reduce information floods that may result from multiple sources of data, and minimise workflow interruptions \u2013 e.g. by having to manually perform periodic analyses of incoming data. Overview of the SORMAS Dashboard The SORMAS dashboard has two sections viz. surveillance and contacts; each displayed at a time. These are represented by tabs on the upper right corner of the screen. There are multiple filters for selecting variables of interest e.g. disease, time, etc. Surveillance Dashboard: The Surveillance dashboard has two sections. The upper section displays summary information of case counts of each infectious disease for specified time interval of notification. This is accompanied by graphical display of the difference in number of cases between any two specified time intervals. The lower section displays an epidemiological curve, case status map and indicators for each disease; one at a time. The dashboard has filters for displaying information of specified diseases, times, and places. Contact Dashboard: The contact dashboard displays summary information of individuals reported to have come into contact with probable or confirmed cases of infectious diseases. For a selected disease of interest, the types of contact information displayed include: number of contacts, follow-up status chart and spatial distribution of contacts. Dashboard Glossary Surveillance Dashboard Case status (on epi curve): This is used to group the cases by case classification (confirmed, probable, suspected, not yet classified). Case status map: This is an interactive map that shows the spatial distribution of cases, contacts, events, and their related variables. Epidemiological curve (epi curve): This a histogram of the number of cases of a specified disease by the date of illness onset. An epidemiological curve shows the progression and magnitude of the disease in the population. Fatalities: The number of cases that died from the specified disease. Grouping (on epi curve): This is the unit of time used to scale the horizontal axis of the epi curve. The possible options are: days, weeks, and months. Last report district: The name of the district or local government area that reported the most recent case of a specified disease. Map key: A legend of the map. Map layers: This is an interactive function on the case status map that allows for the visualisation of cases, contacts, events, etc. by various characteristics of interest viz. case classification; reporting levels (facilities, regions, case counts, case incidence proportion), contacts, events, or any appropriate combinations of these variables. New cases: The number of reported cases classified by case classification status (confirmed, probable, suspected, ...). New events: The numbers of events classified by event status (signal, events, screening, cluster). Outbreak notification: Each epidemic prone disease has a predetermined number of case (outbreak threshold) beyond which an outbreak of the disease in question is said to occur. A red flag is automatically displayed on the tab of the disease in question when this outbreak threshold is exceeded. This outbreak notification is per disease, region and district. Test results: The outcome of laboratory investigation of samples (positive, negative, pending, indeterminate). Contacts Dashboard All contacts: The number of contacts classified by contact classification status (unconfirmed, confirmed, not a contact (discarded)). Contact classification chart: A histogram of number of contacts grouped by contact classification status (confirmed, unconfirmed). Contacts in quarantine: The number of contacts in quarantine. Contacts per case: The minimum, maximum, and average number of contacts per case. Data: The type of contact data depicted by the contact chart namely: follow-up status, contact classification, and date of end of follow-up (follow-up until). Follow-up status chart: A histogram of number of contacts grouped by follow-up status (under follow-up, lost to follow-up, completed follow-up, cancelled follow-up). Follow-up until chart: A histogram of number of contacts grouped by their last date of follow up. Grouping (on chart): This is the unit of time used to scale the horizontal axis of the contact chart. The possible options are: days, epi-weeks, and months. Stopped follow-up: The number of contacts which are no longer under follow-up for any of the following reasons: completed follow-up, cancelled follow-up, lost to follow-up, or converted to case. Under follow-up: The number of contacts that are under monitoring (contact follow-up) by a contact tracing team. They are classified by their last visit remark (cooperative, uncooperative, unavailable). Visits: The number of follow-up visits performed classified by visit remark (unavailable, uncooperative, cooperative).","title":"Dashboard"},{"location":"de/Dashboard/#brief-notes","text":"Epidemiological dashboards are digital innovations for real-time visualisation of multiple streams of related data for purposes of surveillance and outbreak management.

By these attributes, dashboards facilitate informed decision making using multiple combinations of indicators and figures obtained from data analyses. In this way, dashboards improve situational awareness - especially for ongoing outbreak responses. Aside from providing visuals for speedy situational assessment, epidemiological dashboards reduce information floods that may result from multiple sources of data, and minimise workflow interruptions \u2013 e.g. by having to manually perform periodic analyses of incoming data. Overview of the SORMAS Dashboard The SORMAS dashboard has two sections viz. surveillance and contacts; each displayed at a time. These are represented by tabs on the upper right corner of the screen. There are multiple filters for selecting variables of interest e.g. disease, time, etc. Surveillance Dashboard: The Surveillance dashboard has two sections. The upper section displays summary information of case counts of each infectious disease for specified time interval of notification. This is accompanied by graphical display of the difference in number of cases between any two specified time intervals. The lower section displays an epidemiological curve, case status map and indicators for each disease; one at a time. The dashboard has filters for displaying information of specified diseases, times, and places. Contact Dashboard: The contact dashboard displays summary information of individuals reported to have come into contact with probable or confirmed cases of infectious diseases. For a selected disease of interest, the types of contact information displayed include: number of contacts, follow-up status chart and spatial distribution of contacts. Dashboard Glossary Surveillance Dashboard Case status (on epi curve): This is used to group the cases by case classification (confirmed, probable, suspected, not yet classified). Case status map: This is an interactive map that shows the spatial distribution of cases, contacts, events, and their related variables. Epidemiological curve (epi curve): This a histogram of the number of cases of a specified disease by the date of illness onset. An epidemiological curve shows the progression and magnitude of the disease in the population. Fatalities: The number of cases that died from the specified disease. Grouping (on epi curve): This is the unit of time used to scale the horizontal axis of the epi curve. The possible options are: days, weeks, and months. Last report district: The name of the district or local government area that reported the most recent case of a specified disease. Map key: A legend of the map. Map layers: This is an interactive function on the case status map that allows for the visualisation of cases, contacts, events, etc. by various characteristics of interest viz. case classification; reporting levels (facilities, regions, case counts, case incidence proportion), contacts, events, or any appropriate combinations of these variables. New cases: The number of reported cases classified by case classification status (confirmed, probable, suspected, ...). New events: The numbers of events classified by event status (signal, events, screening, cluster). Outbreak notification: Each epidemic prone disease has a predetermined number of case (outbreak threshold) beyond which an outbreak of the disease in question is said to occur. A red flag is automatically displayed on the tab of the disease in question when this outbreak threshold is exceeded. This outbreak notification is per disease, region and district. Test results: The outcome of laboratory investigation of samples (positive, negative, pending, indeterminate). Contacts Dashboard All contacts: The number of contacts classified by contact classification status (unconfirmed, confirmed, not a contact (discarded)). Contact classification chart: A histogram of number of contacts grouped by contact classification status (confirmed, unconfirmed). Contacts in quarantine: The number of contacts in quarantine.

Case definitions are useful for making uniform decisions of whether or not; an individual has a disease or health event of interest. The clinical criteria include characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease in question. The epidemiological criteria (person, place, and time) include the characteristics of the population at risk (person), the geographical location or distribution of cases or event (place), and the timing of event or outbreak (time). For example, an exposure to possible infection such as a confirmed case, animals, substances, or a geographical area (jurisdiction) with ongoing outbreak will constitute an epidemiological link. Laboratory criteria consist of at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease. Based on the applicable criteria, cases are generally classified into three categories (case classification). These categories in increasing order of certainty of diagnosis are: Suspected case: a person that exhibits compatible clinical signs and/or symptoms of a given disease or syndrome, but without laboratory confirmation. Probable case: a person that exhibits compatible clinical features and has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak, but without laboratory confirmation. Confirmed case: a person that has a laboratory confirmation of disease or syndrome (at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease) with or without clinical symptoms or epidemiological link. Overview of Case Glossary The default view of the case directory displays the list of cases in the system. It also has icons to permit users to perform operations such as creating a case, importing list of cases, exporting cases from the system, and bulk editing of cases. It also displays filters, for viewing the case lists by desired variables. The detailed view displays the list of cases with more variables. The follow-up view displays cases under monitoring (follow-up) with information on the daily status of each case over the follow-up period. For a detailed understanding of the filters and icons on the case directory, we recommend that you first read the section titled \u201cCase Entity\u201d Case Directory: Default and Detailed Views Active cases: To filter active cases. Active cases are those that are still under investigation, follow-up, or clinical management. All cases: To display both active and archived cases. Apply filters: To execute filter selections. Archived cases: To Filter cases that have been archived. Basic export: A feature used to export case data with the variables available on the default view. By date: To filter cases by a time interval of notification or report. The time interval can either be a calendar period or epidemiological week. Case classification: To filter cases by the case classification (unclassified, suspected, probable, confirmed, not a case). Case management export: A feature used to export cases with their associated clinical assessment, prescription and treatment data.

Case definitions are useful for making uniform decisions of whether or not; an individual has a disease or health event of interest. The clinical criteria include characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease in question. The epidemiological criteria (person, place, and time) include the characteristics of the population at risk (person), the geographical location or distribution of cases or event (place), and the timing of event or outbreak (time). For example, an exposure to possible infection such as a confirmed case, animals, substances, or a geographical area (jurisdiction) with ongoing outbreak will constitute an epidemiological link. Laboratory criteria consist of at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease. Based on the applicable criteria, cases are generally classified into three categories (case classification). These categories in increasing order of certainty of diagnosis are: Suspected case: a person that exhibits compatible clinical signs and/or symptoms of a given disease or syndrome, but without laboratory confirmation. Probable case: a person that exhibits compatible clinical features and has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak, but without laboratory confirmation. Confirmed case: a person that has a laboratory confirmation of disease or syndrome (at least one positive pathogen test for an infectious disease) with or without clinical symptoms or epidemiological link.","title":"Brief Notes"},{"location":"en/case_management/#overview-of-case-glossary","text":"The default view of the case directory displays the list of cases in the system.

Common human clinical specimens include blood, serum, stool, urine, saliva, sputum, throat swaps, nasopharyngeal swaps, and nasal swaps. The type of specimen collected depends on the disease under investigation, the nature of the outbreak, and purpose of laboratory investigation (eg. for diagnosis of cases, monitoring seroprevalence, etc). For zoonoses, similar specimen may be taken from vectors or hosts of suspected aetiological agents for purposes of identifying the source of the outbreak. The results of a well conducted laboratory investigation of a sample are as good (useful/valid) as the appropriateness and quality of the sample. Overview of the SORMAS Sample Entity The type of samples documented are specific to the disease in question. A case can have more than one sample documented to be used for diagnosis of a disease. A sample can have one or more pathogen test-or additional test-results with the same or different diseases. However, a sample can have only one final laboratory result, derived from the different pathogen test results. Samples can be taken for all entities linked to a person, for example cases, contacts, event participants, etc. Each sample can be created by linking it to an entity (case, contact, event participants, etc) and hence carries the unique ID of the entity. Samples can be referred to other laboratories for further testing within SORMAS. Sample Directory: Samples View Active samples: To display the list of active samples.
